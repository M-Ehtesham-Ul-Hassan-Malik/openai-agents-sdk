    "# Context Management in OpenAI Agents SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Management** in the OpenAI Agents SDK allows agents to maintain, access, and transfer state information during a conversation or workflow. The SDK uses a special object called RunContextWrapper to manage this context, ensuring that each agent or tool has access to relevant data from the ongoing interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Key Concepts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`RunContextWrapper`**: A wrapper around the current run’s state. It holds inputs, outputs, and metadata for the agent during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Persistence Across Steps**: When agents or tools are invoked, the context allows them to “remember” previous turns or actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Sharing**: Enables sharing of information between agents, tools, and guardrails within the same run.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handoff Management**: When one agent delegates a task to another, the context ensures that necessary data (like user input or prior results) is seamlessly passed along."
