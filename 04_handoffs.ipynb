    "# Handoffs in OpenAI Agents SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "Handoffs enable collaboration between multiple agents within a single system. When one agent determines that another is better suited to handle a specific part of a task, it can hand off control — passing context, inputs, and relevant state — to that agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to build multi-agent workflows, where each agent specializes in a particular domain (e.g., a “Research Agent,” “Summarization Agent,” or “Email Agent”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about handoffs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They allow task delegation between agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The receiving agent continues the conversation or processing seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The SDK manages the transfer of context and memory between agents automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Useful for complex, multi-step systems that require different skills or tools at different stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Customer Support Agent handing off a billing issue to a Finance Agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Research Agent handing summarized findings to a Report-Writing Agent.\n",

Introduction to Recursion**\\n- Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve a problem. It breaks the problem into smaller subproblems until it reaches a base case.\\n\\n**2. How Recursion Works in Java**\\n- When a method calls itself, a new stack frame is added to the call stack until a base condition is met. Then the stack frames unwind as the method completes.\\n\\n**3. Base Case and Recursive Case**\\n- Every recursive method needs:\\n  - A *base case* (when to stop calling itself)\\n  - A *recursive case* (how to reduce the problem's size)\\n\\n**4. Examples of Recursion**\\n- *Factorial Example:*\\n  ```java\\n  int factorial(int n) {\\n      if (n == 0) return 1; // base case\\n      else return n * factorial(n - 1); // recursive case\\n  }\\n  ```\\n- *Fibonacci Example:*\\n  ```java\\n  int fibonacci(int n) {\\n      if (n == 0) return 0;\\n      if (n == 1) return 1;\\n      return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);\\n  }\\n  ```\\n\\n**5. Benefits and Drawbacks of Recursion**\\n- *Benefits:* Elegant, concise solutions for inherently recursive problems (e.g., tree traversal).\\n- *Drawbacks:* Can lead to high memory usage and slower performance for large inputs.\\n\\n**6. Common Mistakes with Recursion**\\n- Missing or incorrect base case (causes infinite recursion).\\n- Not reducing the problem size.\\n- StackOverflowError due to too many recursive calls.\\n\\n**7. When to Use Recursion vs. Iteration**\\n- Use recursion for naturally recursive problems (trees, graphs).\\n- Prefer iteration for simple repeated tasks or when efficiency is a concern.\\n\\n**8. Memory Usage and Stack Overflow**\\n- Each recursive call uses stack memory. Deep recursion can cause a StackOverflowError.\\n\\n**9. Tail Recursion**\\n- Tail recursion occurs when the recursive call is the last line in the method. Java does not optimize tail calls, but writing tail-recursive methods can still prevent excessive stack use in some cases.\\n\\n**10. Real-world Applications of Recursion**\\n- Directory traversal\\n- Parsing hierarchical data (like XML/JSON)\\n- Solving puzzles (like Sudoku, Towers of Hanoi)\\n\\n**11. Practice Problems**\\n- Write a method to compute the sum of all elements in an array using recursion.\\n- Write a recursive method to reverse a string.\\n\\n*Tip:* Always test recursive methods with edge cases and check for the correct base case!\"\n"
