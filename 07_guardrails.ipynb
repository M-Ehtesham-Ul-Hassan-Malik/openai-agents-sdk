    "**Guardrails** are safety and control mechanisms that define what an agent can and cannot do.\n",
    "They ensure that the agentâ€™s behavior stays within desired boundaries, preventing unsafe, irrelevant, or unauthorized actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the OpenAI Agents SDK, guardrails can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enforce content safety and block disallowed topics or outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Restrict which tools or handoffs an agent can access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply input/output validation before the model processes or returns data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define policies for agent interaction (e.g., escalation, refusals, or filtering).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, \n",
    "> guardrails act as a layer of protection and control, ensuring that your AI agent behaves reliably, ethically, and safely according to your design and organizational policies."

      "Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, had several reasons for opposing the establishment of Israel in 1948. Here are some key points to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Support for Palestine**: Jinnah was a strong advocate for the rights of Palestinians. He believed that the establishment of Israel would lead to the displacement and suffering of the Palestinian people, who were already facing significant challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Political Solidarity**: Jinnah's opposition to Israel was rooted in the broader context of anti-colonial sentiments. Many leaders in the Muslim world viewed the establishment of Israel as a continuation of Western imperialism. Jinnah, therefore, aligned himself with the broader movement for self-determination and justice for oppressed peoples.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Religious and Cultural Connections**: As a prominent Muslim leader, Jinnah understood the cultural and religious significance of Palestine to Muslims worldwide. He felt a sense of duty to support Muslim populations facing adversity, including those in Palestine.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Strategic Considerations**: Jinnah recognized that the creation of Israel could potentially destabilize the entire region, leading to conflict that would affect neighboring countries, including Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **National Identity**: Jinnah was focused on establishing a nation-state for Muslims in South Asia, and he viewed the situation in Palestine as relevant to the larger struggle for Muslim identity and rights in a post-colonial world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding these factors provides insight into Jinnah's position regarding Israel and reflects the complexities of international politics in the mid-20th century.\n"
