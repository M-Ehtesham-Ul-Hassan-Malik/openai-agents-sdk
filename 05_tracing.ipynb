    "# Tracing in OpenAI Agents SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "Tracing helps you monitor, debug, and understand what happens during an agent’s execution — including tool calls, handoffs, reasoning steps, and model responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a detailed log of each step the agent takes while processing a request. With tracing, you can see:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How the model interpreted your prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which tools were called (and with what inputs/outputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "- When handoffs occurred between agents\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any errors or intermediate reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It’s Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps you debug agent behavior (e.g., why it didn’t call a tool).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Makes it easier to optimize workflows and identify bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Essential for observability when building complex multi-agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tracing in the Agents SDK provides deep visibility into your agents’ decisions, making it easier to debug, evaluate, and improve their behavior."
