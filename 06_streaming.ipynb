    "## What Streaming Does\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, when you call a model, it processes your input fully and then returns a final response.\n",
    "With streaming, the model starts sending partial responses (tokens, tool calls, events, etc.) as soon as they are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the interaction more **responsive** and **conversational**, especially for chat-based or real-time apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the OpenAI Agents SDK, streaming refers to the process of receiving real-time, incremental updates from the model as it generates output — instead of waiting for the complete response."
